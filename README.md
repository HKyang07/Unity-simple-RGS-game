# Unity-simple-RGS-game
Simulation of the Rehabilitation Gaming System in Unity

A simple implementation of the Rehabilitation Gaming System game part.  
The reference video is here: http://rgs-project.eu/system-overview

I use keyboard instead of Kinect and gloves, WASD move left hand, IJKL move right hand, SPACE do catch action, two hands must catch the balls simultaneously, SHIFT drop the ball.  
See more detail description in introduction.txt.  

The executable file is RGS.exe and the RGS_Data is game resources, all zip file need to be extracted.  
The critical source code is in /myscript.

Here are some game screenshots:
